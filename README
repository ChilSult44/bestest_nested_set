BestestNestedSet
==============

This acts_as extension provides Nested Set functionality.  Nested Set is similiar to Tree, but with the added feature that you can select the children and all of their descendents with a single query.  A good use case for this is a threaded post system, where you want to display every reply to a comment without multiple selects.

This is a modification of the normal acts_as_nested set provided by DHH.

Usage is the same.  Provides ability to renumber children when swapping nodes around in your tree, as well as some more helpers like is_child_of?(parent) to see whether or not you're a child node.

Example
=======

  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_nested_set
  end
